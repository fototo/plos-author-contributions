{"name":"PLOS Author Contributions","tagline":"Text-mining and analyzing author contributions in PLOS articles","body":"This was the result of a [Hack4ac](http://hack4ac.com/) team on 6th July 2013 working to mine and analyse article data from the [PLOS Search API](http://api.plos.org/) and [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/) for detailed author contributions.\r\n\r\nSeveral aspects were developed simultaneously:\r\n\r\n* A PeerJ integration to pull author contribution information;\r\n* A PLOS API bridge that queries the PLOS API, enriches it with author contribution information and converts it to CSV on the fly;\r\n* A purely [R](http://www.r-project.org/)-based implementation of mining PLOS for author contributions and a subsequent statistical analysis. This project is described in more detailed [here](plos_author_contributions.html).\r\n\r\n### PLOS API Bridge\r\n\r\nThe PLOS API bridge can be found under `plos-api` and is written in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) with [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/). To run it, ensure you set a `PLOS_API_KEY` environment variable like so:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ export PLOS_API_KEY=decafbad\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can run the web application with [Thin](http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/) (as it streams responses):\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ bundle install\r\n$ bundle exec thin start\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen to return CSV from PLOS, simply hit the root of the application:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /\r\nDOI,Publication Date,Author Position,Author Name,Initials,Conceived and designed the experiments,Performed the experiments,Analyzed the data,Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools,Wrote the paper\r\n10.1371/journal.pone.0020946,2011-06-14T00:00:00Z,1,Olga Pantos,OP,1,1,1,1,1\r\n10.1371/journal.pone.0020946,2011-06-14T00:00:00Z,2,Ove Hoegh-Guldberg,OH-G,0,0,0,1,0\r\n10.1371/journal.pone.0029670,2011-12-28T00:00:00Z,1,Xiaowen Liu,XWL,1,1,1,0,1\r\n10.1371/journal.pone.0029670,2011-12-28T00:00:00Z,2,Hong Cai,HC,1,0,0,1,0\r\n10.1371/journal.pone.0029670,2011-12-28T00:00:00Z,5,Yingqiang Shi,YQS,1,0,0,1,0\r\n10.1371/journal.pone.0029670,2011-12-28T00:00:00Z,6,Yanong Wang,YNW,1,0,0,1,0\r\n10.1371/journal.pone.0029670,2011-12-28T00:00:00Z,4,Ziwen Long,ZWL,0,0,1,0,0\r\n10.1371/journal.pone.0029670,2011-12-28T00:00:00Z,3,Hua Huang,HH,0,0,1,0,0\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can tweak the number of results returned by passing a `limit` parameter like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /?limit=1000\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Datasets\r\n\r\nPrepared datasets can be found under the `data` directory and are all in CSV format with descriptive headers.\r\n\r\n### Team Members\r\n\r\n![Group photo](https://raw.github.com/hack4ac/plos-author-contributions/master/group_foto.jpg)\r\n\r\n(Clockwise from bottom left.)\r\n\r\n* @waltherg\r\n* @hubgit\r\n* @jdleesmiller\r\n* @mudge\r\n* @cbudjan\r\n* @mfenner (not pictured)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
