{"name":"PLOS Author Contributions","tagline":"Text-mining and analyzing author contributions in PLOS articles","body":"This was the result of a [Hack4ac](http://hack4ac.com/) team on 6th July 2013 working to mine and analyse article data from the [PLOS Search API](http://api.plos.org/) and PeerJ for detailed author contributions.\r\n\r\nSeveral aspects were developed simultaneously:\r\n\r\n* A [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/) integration to pull author contribution information;\r\n* A PLOS API bridge that queries the PLOS API, enriches it with author contribution information and converts it to CSV on the fly;\r\n* A purely [R](http://www.r-project.org/)-based implementation of mining PLOS for author contributions and a subsequent statistical analysis. This project is described in more detailed [here](plos_author_contributions.md).\r\n\r\n### PLOS API Bridge\r\n\r\nThe PLOS API bridge can be found under `plos-api` and is written in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) with [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/). To run it, ensure you set a `PLOS_API_KEY` environment variable like so:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ export PLOS_API_KEY=decafbad\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can run the web application with [Thin](http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/) (as it streams responses):\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ bundle install\r\n$ bundle exec thin start\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Datasets\r\n\r\nPrepared datasets can be found under the `data` directory and are all in CSV format.\r\n\r\n### Team Members\r\n\r\n![Group photo](https://raw.github.com/hack4ac/plos-author-contributions/master/group_foto.jpg)\r\n\r\n* @cbudjan\r\n* @hubgit\r\n* @jdleesmiller\r\n* @mfenner\r\n* @mudge\r\n* @waltherg","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
