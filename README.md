PLOS Author Contributions
=========================

Text-mining and analyzing author contributions in PLOS articles

Background
----------

This project is part of the [hack4ac](http://hack4ac.com) event taking place in London July 6, 2013. The goals of the event are twofold:

* Demonstrate the value of the CC-BY licence within academia. We are interested in supporting innovations around and on top of the literature.
* Reach out to academics who are keen to learn or improve their programming skills to better their research. Weâ€™re especially interested in academics who have never coded before.
